# dynamic-structures-C
a loose collection of different dynamic memory structures in C

About the repositry: 
I know that there is no actual use for the dynamic structures, as there surely are much better libraries for those already. I'm programming them form scratch following my uni's course on C, and I'm making it into just one project so that when I need some of the structures for later projects I already have all of them in one place.
